							Welcome to Zeem ("Zeem," "we," "us" or "our"). 
							Zeem provides a fast, beautiful and fun way for you to share media through 
							our content-sharing platform. Just snap a photo, choose a filter to transform the look 
							and feel, add comments (if you like) and share! <br/>
							This Policy describes the information we process to support Zeem and other products by Zeem.
							</h4>
                            <div class="space-30"></div>
							<h3>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
							<p>We collect the following types of information.</p>
							<p><strong>Information you provide us directly:</strong></p>
                            <p>
								<ul>
									<li>Your name, phone number and e-mail address when you register for an Zeem account.</li>
									<li>Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone number). This information allows us to help you or others be "found" on Zeem.</li>
									<li>User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.</li>
									<li>Communications between you and Zeem. For example, we may send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p><strong>Finding your friends on Zeem:</strong></p>
							<p>We get the contacts from your mobile and used to find friends on Zeem</p>
                            <p><strong>Analytics information:</strong></p>
							<p>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User.</p>
							
							<p><strong>Metadata:</strong></p>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted.</li>
									<li>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							
							<h3>2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
							
							<p>In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use information that we receive to: </p>
							
							<ul>
								<li>help you efficiently access your information after you sign in</li>
								<li>remember information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Service;</li>
								<li>provide personalized content and information to you and others, which could include online ads or other forms of marketing</li>
								<li>provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service</li>
								<li>develop and test new products and features</li>
								<li>monitor metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns</li>
								<li>diagnose or fix technology problems</li>
								<li>automatically update the Zeem application on your device</li>
								<li>Zeem or other Users may run contests, special offers or other events or activities ("Events") on the Service. If you do not want to participate in an Event, do not use the particular Metadata (i.e. hashtag or geotag) associated with that Event.</li>
							</ul>
							
							<h3>3. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
							<p>We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Zeem (or the group of companies of which Zeem is a part) without your consent, except as noted in this Policy. </p>
								
							<p><strong>Parties with whom we may share your information:</strong></p>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>We may share User Content and your information (including but not limited to, information from cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally part of the same group of companies that Zeem is part of, or that become part of that group ("Affiliates"). Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service (including by providing analytics) and Affiliates' own services (including by providing you with better and more relevant experiences). But these Affiliates will honor the choices you make about who can see your photos.</li>
									<li>We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and device identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to you ("Service Providers"). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.</li>
									<li>We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners. This information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</li>
									<li>We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties. We may also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer associated with you and share that aggregated information.</li>
									
								</ul>
							</p>
							
							<p><strong>Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:</strong></p>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you set. To change your privacy settings on the Service, please change your profile setting. Once you have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others.</li>
									<li>Subject to your profile and privacy settings, any User Content that you make public is searchable by other Users and subject to use under our Zeem API. The use of the Zeem API is subject to the API Terms of Use which incorporates the terms of this Privacy Policy.</li>
									<li>If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other Users or third parties using the Zeem API have copied or saved that information.</li>
									
								</ul>
							</p>
							
							<p><strong>What happens in the event of a change of control:</strong></p>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Zeem or our assets to another organization (e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation), your information such as name and email address, User Content and any other information collected through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your User Content. The buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy.</li>
									
								</ul>
							</p>
							
							<p><strong>Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:</strong></p>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you may be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							
							<h3>4. HOW WE STORE YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
							
							<p><strong>Storage and Processing:</strong></p>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>Your information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Zeem, its Affiliates or Service Providers maintain facilities.</li>
									<li>Zeem, its Affiliates, or Service Providers may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.</li>
									<li>By registering for and using the Service you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or to any other country in which Zeem, its Affiliates or Service Providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.</li>

However, Zeem cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to Zeem or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.</li>
									<li>Please do your part to help us. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to emails between you and Zeem, at all times. Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes the social media services you connect to Zeem make to their services.

								</ul>
